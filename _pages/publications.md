## Working Papers

**The Economic Impact of the American Civil War on Northern Textile Towns** [[PDF]](/files/civil war ma.pdf)
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
I examine the effects of the American Civil War on Northern manufacturing by considering the massive supply shock to the female-dominated cotton textiles industry in Massachusetts. Using newly digitized 19th-century manufacturing censuses and a differences-in-differences identification strategy, I find that the war did not hinder long-run growth. Although wartime female employment dropped substantially in textile-producing towns, it recovered within ten years, as did the cotton textiles industry. Male employment and manufacturing output were unaffected. A lack of wartime outmigration partially explains the immediate recovery, which contrasts with the British experience of the same shock.

**Efficiency and Distributional Effects of Federal College Subsidies during the Great Depression** (with Gerald Jaynes) [[PDF]](/files/Efficiency and Distributional Effects of Federal College Subsidies.pdf)
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
We conduct the first quantitative assessment of federal college subsidies during the 1930s.  Overlapping generation households invest in children’s education to maximize multigenerational utility, and the government subsidizes college to maximize enrollment subject to a budget constraint and recipients satisfying ability and income qualifications.  A modelling innovation assigns children educational ability through a random regression to the population mean correlated with father’s presumed ability ranking via his percentile in fathers’ earnings distribution.  Simulating the theoretical model, the equilibrium that replicates actual education distributions estimates federal college subsidies increased graduation rates of the cohort of White Americans reaching college age during the 1930s by 22.12% for men and 19.16% for women; the mean ability of subsidy recipients exceeded non-subsidized students’ mean .4 s.d.  The program favored middle income groups.  Most benefits accrued to high ability students with fathers in the 4th through 6th deciles of fathers’ earnings distribution.  The subsidies had no effect on the graduation rates of high ability students in the bottom two deciles of fathers’ earnings.  A more universal government policy that maximized stipends subject only to the budget and income criteria would have increased annual stipends by about 50 thousand while only decreasing college students’ mean ability .13 s.d.  Gender biases favoring higher male graduation rates remain a puzzle.
